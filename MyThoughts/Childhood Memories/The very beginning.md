## 1975
My very first memory is when I was 3 years old. I know this because this is the year when Pinky was born. December 1975. 
I remember holding my little brothers hand and climbing up a dark dirty staircase with an old lady, our house maid, to see my new born baby sister in hospital. 
I remember being scared and excited. I was already Tai to my younger brother. And now an added responsibility.
