Under a pile of old photographs in a box, I found it! 

A wedding photograph. A unique wedding photograph. Black and white, with grey edges. Faded, but not too much. Spinning me down memory lane like Alice.

The Naik family were a small family of 4 - Manish, Sameet and their Parents.
Naik uncle was always "Manish che Baba" for us kids. He was a huge man, with a round face and twinkling eyes.

The Naik family lived on the 2nd floor of the small apartment building - part of a society of 6 buildings. We lived on the 1st floor. The families were very close. The children were all friends, but it was Naik Uncle who was everyone's favourite friend.

Every morning, like clockwork, he would descend the stairs on his way to office - never in a hurry. Always stopped for a minute to say hello to me, smile and tease me and then went on his way. Every evening he would return around 7:00 pm, again stopping on the way up, smile and talk to me, before going home. He made a 11 year old girl feel special!

What really kept Manish che baba alive in my memory was his love for photography. Every occasion - be it birthdays, society get togethers, festivals or just a bright Sunday morning playing in the sun - he would be there with his camera hanging around his neck. Those were the pre-smart phone days. Digital cameras had not made their appearance.

His favourite Kodak captured black and white memories for future generations to reminiscence. My childhood has been pickled in a bunch of black and white.

And we created occassions to celebrate our times together - childish occassions. One such was the wedding. 

Between the children we had two cute dolls - one a petite doll and another a handsome gudda. And we decided to celebrate the wedding of our favourite gudda and guddi. Gudda got a new shirt and pant, and guddi got a new blouse and red saree. We dressed them up real bright. Special food was prepared - bhel, batata wada, orange juice and a wedding cake. Aai was the chef, and happily preparing all the specialities.
