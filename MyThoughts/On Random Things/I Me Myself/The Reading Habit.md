Happy Makarasankranti.

Today is an auspicious day for new beginnings. So,here I am!

**The reading habit**

This is probably the first time that im writing in digital form. I always preferred pen and paper. But I get the difficulty of writing in pen, it is very difficult to revise and review.

So I have always dreamed of being a writer. OK, that must have been heard a zillion times by the world. And no, that not fully true.

What I always dreamed of was being a librarian. To be able to sit and read all those lovely books, to be surrounded by them, and that being my only job! I remember this distinctly from Karwar library. I used to love going there, searching along rows and rows of shelves of books. Getting a good book, and then coming home to read and get lost in it. I used to be so engreossed I would not hear lunch or dinner calls. Some days Aai n pappa used to be angry,but mostly amused. Specially when I was gorging on P.G. Wodehouse. I would be laughing so much, everyone call me mad. All 4 of them, aai, pappa, prashant ND pinky would be staring at me like I had escaped from the mad hpuse. And I could not explain my uncontrollable laughter as they did not read Wodehouse!

Aai was a reader. She used to read in marathi, modtly novels and crime stories. But she did inculcate the reading habit in me. When we were younger, I remember reading bundles of tinkle,chanda mama, supe man, bat man, chahcha Chowdhary!

Aah, sweet memories…

Then in eighth class my friend introduced me to Agatha Christie and Wodehouse..and then I was on a roll. I couldnt stop reading. I grabbed every book from our school library and our public library and read. Ah those days of discovery. In college, I continued reading even during exams all my friends knew that I had a novel inside my text book even during exam times. I preferred the imaginary to the real world. The consequence being I barely managed to scrape through the exams.

But reading kept me sane. Opened my eyes to the outside world. Once out of college, in the real world, I lost myself for a few years. I did join libraries wherever I was for the moment staying – Ahmedabad, Pune, Karwar, Vasco and finally after marriage, Panjim.

Marriage brought in some bitter reality. And yet, I continued reading. Lack of internet in that age limited my exposure to the different authors.

Ever since childhood, I also loved to write. One of my oldest memories of writing is having a Pen Pal and writing letters to him. I wrote funny letters, describing our school life on small one page inland letters. I also wrote longer letters on various topics and sent them in envelopes. I also received a lot of letters from him. But after a couple of years, the friendship was broken and we lost touch.

My friends list from childhood till date:

I was born in Dombivli in Ellora Society. My first friends list begins here.

Manish may be the very first friend I ever had. We also went to school together, so we had and have a few common friends from Adarsh English school. I remember faintly a few names – Satish, Kalyani. In Ellora, I had Monali Rao (revived friednship recently, and am super glad!) Rita Patankar, Keerthi.

And then there were all the kids – I always was good with kids. Sameet, Amarja, Veena.

Then we moved to Karwar. I met Nandini and Nagavalli when I was in class 8. For 5 years, we were a trio! We passed 10th and went to same college till 12th. And we lost touch again! I have been looking for both of them randomly and yes they may be available on the wide internet, but I have lost contact.

Then in engg college, I made great friends with Anjali.
