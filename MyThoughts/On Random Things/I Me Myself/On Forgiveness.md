I want to be a kind to myself!

I have gone through my personal diaries from last 5 to 8 years.
There is a recurring theme of achieving this, that...

When I compare it to my entries for 2025, I find them so similar.

So does it mean I have not achieved anything in the last 10 years? No, its not like that.

I may not have become the millionaire I aimed to be, I may not have lost 20 Kgs! I have not been consistent, I have been lazy.

But I have arrived in 2025, no worse than I was in say 2015! I have gone through so many challenges in the last 10 years.

Race for survival - Pinky
Fight with Alcohol - Sanjay
Violet Loss - Violet & Prashant
Loss of parents - Aai & Pappa

I deserve a kind tap on the head, a pat on the shoulders. And no one else is going to do it for me, I will do it myself!

Well done Sheetal!
