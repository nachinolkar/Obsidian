The process of thinking

Its so tiresome to think
To connect with ones own self

Lest one may need to take some action -
Its easier to let go, go with the flow
Thereby shirking all responsibility of the result of ones own actions

But, does it not then bring one
The responsibility of one's inaction?

Its so tiresome to think
Thoughts that one has no control over.
